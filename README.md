# HCAHPS-Patient-Survey-Dashboard-


This project analyzes 9 years of Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey data to uncover trends in patient experience across U.S. hospitals. Using Power BI and DAX, I created a two-page interactive dashboard that highlights both national and state-level insights.

**ðŸ“Š Project Overview**

The HCAHPS survey is the first national, standardized survey of patientsâ€™ perspectives of hospital care. It measures domains such as:

Nurse Communication

Doctor Communication

Discharge Information

Quietness of the Hospital Environment

Care Transitions and more

**Questions:**
This project answers four guiding questions:

1. Have hospitals improved in their quality of care over the past 9 years?
2. Which areas of care have made the most progress?
3. How have scores changed over time?
4. What recommendations can help hospitals further improve patient experience?
