# HCAHPS-Patient-Survey-Dashboard-


This project analyzes 9 years of Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey data to uncover trends in patient experience across U.S. hospitals. Using Power BI and DAX, I created a two-page interactive dashboard that highlights both national and state-level insights.

**ðŸ“Š Project Overview**

The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) is the first national, standardized survey of patientsâ€™ perspectives of hospital care in the United States. It provides critical insights into how patients experience different aspects of their care, from nurse and doctor communication to hospital cleanliness, discharge information, and transitions of care.

This project set out to analyze 9 years of HCAHPS survey data (2013â€“2022) in order to better understand how patient experience has evolved nationally, and to highlight where hospitals are improving versus where they continue to face challenges. The analysis was guided by four key questions:

**1. Have hospitals improved in their quality of care over the past 9 years?**

**2. Which areas of care have made the most progress?**

**3. How have scores changed over time?**

**4. What recommendations can help hospitals further improve patient experience?**

**To answer these questions, I designed a two-page interactive Power BI dashboard:**

1. The first page focuses on national-level results, tracking long-term trends and highlighting the strongest and weakest measures.
2. The second page drills down into state-level insights, revealing regional variations and allowing comparisons across states and measures.

**The project followed a structured data workflow:**

1. Data modeling using a star schema with fact tables (National Results, State Results, Responses) and dimension tables (Measures, Questions, States, Dates).
2. Custom metrics created in DAX, including an NPS-style score (Top-box % â€“ Bottom-box %), year-over-year changes, and progress rankings across measures.

**Features of the Datasets**

For this project, I worked with multiple tables from the HCAHPS dataset, covering patient experience survey results at the national, state, and facility level.

**1. Reports Table:**

      Release Period (PK): The reporting period (e.g., 07_2019).
      
      Start Date / End Date: The time range for each survey period.

**2. States Table:**

      State (PK): Two-letter state code.
      
      State Name: Full name of the state.
      
      Region: Census region grouping for states.

**3. Measures Table:**
      
      Measure ID (PK): Unique identifier for each measure.
      
      Measure: The type of patient experience being measured (e.g., Nurse Communication, Cleanliness).
      
      Type: Category of the measure.

**4. Questions Table:**

      Question Num: Identifier for each survey question.
      
      Measure ID (FK): Links the question to its measure.
      
      Question: The actual survey question asked.

      Bottom-box / Middle-box / Top-box Answer: The response categories used in HCAHPS reporting.

**5. National Results Table:**
      
      Release Period (FK): Links to the reporting period.
      
      Measure ID (FK): Links to the measure being evaluated.
      
      Bottom-box %, Middle-box %, Top-box %: National percentages of patient responses.

**6. State Results Table:**

      Release Period (FK): Links to the reporting period.
      
      State (FK): Links to the state.
      
      Measure ID (FK): Links to the measure.

      Bottom-box %, Middle-box %, Top-box %: Percentages of responses at the state level.

**7. Responses Table:**

      Release Period (FK): Reporting period.

      State (FK): State code.
      
      Facility ID: Unique identifier for each hospital/facility.
      
      Completed Surveys: Number of completed patient surveys.
      
      Response Rate (%): Percentage of patients who responded.

**ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights**

1. Patient experience improved nationally from 2013â€“2020, peaked in 2021, then dipped post-pandemic.
2. Nurse & Doctor Communication are strong points across the decade.
3. Communication about Medicines, Care Transition, and Quietness of Hospital consistently underperform.
4. State-level analysis revealed wide variation across regions, with some outperforming national averages while others lagged.
